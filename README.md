### Lessons Learned
The inspiration for this app was Trello and Github Projects, so far I have not added all the functionality of these but I did achieve my objective of solidify my understanding of React/Redux. Before this project I struggled to understand the flow of data through Redux, but now I have a solid foundation and can quickly map states to props.
